	Influences (Brief)
		- <Super Mario 64>
			- Controls
	- The first and most iconic of the 3D platform genre. Though it has aged considerably, it is still well renowned for its polished and intuitive controls. It is the archetype of 3D platformers, and the game against which all newcomers must be judged.
		- <GTAV Platformer maps>
			- Content
			- Although the game is ill-suited to the genre, a widespread 
	User-base has developed for these maps. They feature somewhat nonsensical construction of platforms and other elements from objects ordinarily found in the  game world, such as fuel tanks, cars, cargo containers, barricades, signs, etc.
		- <Gang Beasts>
			- Art style
	- A fighting game which features stylized interpretations of humans fighting in various locations. The art style is very low-fidelity, focusing on an interesting color palette, silhouette readability, and character customization. The game features costumes which can be equipped that drastically change the appearance of the characters while maintaining instant recognizability.
